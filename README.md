# BlockPropeller

BlockPropeller is a platform for easily and efficiently deploying your own Binance Chain infrastructure.

BlockPropeller provides you with an intuitive user interface to help you configure your ideal setup of Binance Chain nodes.
Whether you want to join a testnet or run your own production nodes, BlockPropeller has you covered.

What makes BlockPropeller stand out from other managed infrastructure services, is that it provisions all
of your infrastructure on your own machines. While BlockPropeller takes care of creating the required infrastructure, 
setting up individual servers and monitors created nodes if they are working correctly, you always have the ability
to opt out of using BlockPropeller, while keeping your existing infrastructure. 

We know that running your own nodes sometimes requires that you run it without any third parties involved, 
so we provide you with a simple and clean way of cutting communication between BlockPropeller and your servers.
